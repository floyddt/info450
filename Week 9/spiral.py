#Steps to solve this problem
#1. How do I make a 5 by 5 spiral?
    #a. Input as single number so it can multiply by itself to form the spiral. 
#2. How do I put the first number in the middle?
    #a. 2 dimensional array to match coordinates with the number in the array.
    #b. Make function start from the coordinates of the number 1. 
#3. How do I increase the count to create the following pattern?
    #a. Right 1, down 1, left 2 up 2, right 3, down 3, etc.
#4. How do I sum the diagonal numbers in a spiral?
    #Use a function to sum numbers pointing to the coordinates along the diagonals
    #in the 2 dimensional array.
